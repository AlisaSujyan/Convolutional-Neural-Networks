## CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project focuses on image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. I experimented with several deep learning architectures, and the best performance was achieved using the ResNet-50 model.
### Models tested
I tested the following convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures:

* ResNet-18

* VGG-16

* ResNet-50 (Best performance)

### Best hyperparameters
* batch_size = 128
* epochs = 20  
* learning_rate = 0.001

### Conclusion
Among the tested architectures, ResNet-50 outperformed the others on the CIFAR-10 classification task, achieving a test accuracy of 91.17%.
